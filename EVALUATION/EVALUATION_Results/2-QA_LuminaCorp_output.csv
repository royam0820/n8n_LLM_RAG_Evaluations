Where is the reset button?,"The reset button is hidden under the base rubber pad. The engineering team moved the button to this concealed location—rather than placing it on the back of the device—specifically to prevent accidental resets.
This design choice acts like a safety latch on a power tool: it ensures that engaging the function requires a deliberate, two-step action (lifting the device and accessing the pad) rather than a simple, accidental press.",The reset button is located underneath the base rubber pad of the device [1].,30,9,2025-12-09T15:49:09.669Z,2025-12-10T20:54:51.922Z
What is the suggested launch price?,"The team tentatively agreed to set the launch price at $199.
This decision was reached after a negotiation between Sales and Product teams regarding margins and market viability:
• Initial Proposal: Mike from Sales originally suggested a lower price of $149 to capture the college demographic.
• Cost Constraints: Sarah (Product) rejected the $149 price point because the unit cost is $110, driven largely by the use of ""new glass casing"". This would have left zero margin for marketing efforts.
• The Compromise: To justify the higher $199 price tag to consumers, the team agreed to bundle 6 months of the 'Pro' app subscription for free.
The pricing discussion here acted like a balancing scale: the team had to add the ""weight"" of the free software subscription on one side to offset the heavier hardware costs on the other, finding an equilibrium that satisfied both financial margins and consumer value",The suggested launch price for the device is $199 with 6 months of the Pro app subscription included [1].,30,10,2025-12-09T15:49:09.669Z,2025-12-10T20:54:54.003Z
"What was the final decision on the pricing, and who initially disagreed with it?","Mike from Sales proposed the initial launch price of $149.
He suggested this specific price point because he feared that exceeding $200 would cause the company to ""lose the college demographic"". However, this proposal was rejected by Sarah (Product) because the unit cost of the device is $110 due to the new glass casing; selling at Mike's proposed price would leave the team with ""zero wiggle room for marketing"".
Mike's strategy here was like trying to fill a stadium by selling tickets below cost—while it might guarantee a full house (high sales volume), the venue (the company) wouldn't make enough money to keep the lights on.",,25,11,2025-12-09T15:49:09.670Z,2025-12-10T20:55:04.171Z
"For the Lumina Sphere, what is the cost per unit?","The cost per unit is currently $110.
Elena from Engineering explicitly states that the company is ""sitting at $110 per unit cost"" specifically due to the inclusion of the new glass casing. This high manufacturing cost was the determining factor that forced the team to abandon the proposed $149 price point, as it would have left ""zero wiggle room for marketing""",The cost per unit is $75 [1].,30,12,2025-12-09T15:49:09.671Z,2025-12-10T20:55:05.494Z
